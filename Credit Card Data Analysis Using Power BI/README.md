# Credit Card Data Analysis Using Power BI

This project is my attempt to learn and create an data analysis using Power Bi. The main focus will be on importing, transforming, and visualising the dataset on credit card defaults. 


### Steps-

* The dataset is available on UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* Fixing the column names:
    * In this dataset, converting the row 2 as the column name gives much clearer understanding of the data instead of pre-existing names.
    * Rename the second last column to DEFAULT, and the last column to STATES.
